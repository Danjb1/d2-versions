# Diablo II - Version Guide

This project serves as a guide to quickly switching between different versions of Diablo II: Lord of Destruction. This is not intended to be a fully automatic solution, although such tools do exist.

## Setup

Our end goal is to have a collection of folders like so, one for each version we're interested in:
```
.
+-- Versions
|   +-- v1.07 (Base)
|   |-- v1.12a
|   |-- v1.13d
|   |-- v1.14d
```

A similar directory structure can be found within this project. The files themselves aren't provided here, but a list of required files can be found in each folder.

So where do you get the required files? Read on...

> In a hurry? You can find all of these files online, for example at the bottom of [this page](http://plugy.free.fr/en/index.html).

### v1.07 (Base Version)

This is the default version of the game if you perform a fresh install, so the files can be obtained that way.

### Patches

Once you have the base version, you can simply install one of the official patches, and the files in your game directory will be updated accordingly.

The patches are all hosted by Blizzard, and follow this URL format:

 - **1.12a:** http://ftp.blizzard.com/pub/diablo2exp/patches/PC/LODPatch_112a.exe
 - **1.13d:** http://ftp.blizzard.com/pub/diablo2exp/patches/PC/LODPatch_113d.exe
 - **1.14d:** http://ftp.blizzard.com/pub/diablo2exp/patches/PC/LODPatch_114d.exe

## Instructions

Once you have the required files, switching to any version is as simple as grabbing a clean install and copying in the required files from a later patch:

1. Copy the v1.07 files into a clean folder (or into an existing Diablo II folder).
2. Copy the files from the desired version into this folder, and overwrite when prompted.
